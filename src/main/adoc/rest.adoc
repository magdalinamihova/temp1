# REST

## History

Doctoral thesis of Dr. Roy Fielding (late '90s, early '2000)

## REST Definition

- *Re* presentational
- *S* tate
- *T* ransfer

## Common mistake

REST vs RESTful

## HTTP methods (aka verbs)

- GET (Read)
- POST (Create)
- PUT (Replace)
- PATCH (Update)
- DELETE (Delete)
- HEAD (used by proxy)

- OPTION
- CONNECT
- TRACE

### HTTP History

Purpose: Transport Hypertext Markup Language Documents, created for exchange of academic papers

Sir Tim Berners Lee

CERN Institute

## REST vs RPCs etc.

### Richardson Maturity Model

- 0 Swamp of POX
- 1 URIs (remote procedure calls)
- 2 HTTP (leverage HTTP methods)
- 3 Hypermedia (HAL, Hateoas)

### REST API Design

-> APIGee

- /api/books
- /api/books/{key}

|===
|HTTP methods | /api/books | /api/books/{key}

|GET | Read Book[] | Read Book
|POST | Create | n/a
|PUT | ? (n/a) | Replace*
|PATCH | n/a | Update
|DELETE | ? (n/a) | Delete*
|===

* Idempotency

Complexity of Queries (e.g. Genre) -> QueryString

QueryString: everything behind ?

Resource names: nouns, plural
Operation names: verbs

## Operations should be mapped to routes with verbs

/api/bookStatus/AVL
/api/bookStatus/convert?source=AVL&target=BRW

## HTTP Status Codes

* 100s ... informal
* 200s ... OKish
* 300s ... redirects temp/perm
* 400s ... Client errors
* 500s ... Server errors
* 900s ... custom

### The ones to remember

- 200 OK
- 201 Created
- 204 No Content

- 301 Moved permanently (SEO)
- 307 Redirect temporarily
- 308 Redirect permanently

- 401 Unauthorized
- 403 Forbidden (-> 404)
- 404 Not Found
- 405 Method not allowed

- 500 Internal Server Error (no stacktrace has to be exposed)
